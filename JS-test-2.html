1) When we want to do same task on element more then 2 to 3 times then we use loops.

2) In var we can reasign the variable and change the value of variable but in let we can change
   the value but we can not give same name to the variable. It weill give error.
   
   - The major deffirance between let and var is, Hoistind supports the var. In hoisting delcaration 
     of variable is goes to top of the function. And hoisting is not done in we use let to declare 
     the variable.

3) There are tow types of data types.
 a) Primitive
        Blooen
        Number
        String
        null
        undifine
    
b) Special  
        

4) let sum = 0; 
    let add = (...e) => {
        sum = sum + e;
        return sum; 
    }

add(4,5,6);

5) document.getElementsByClassName("NameOfClass")

6) When we have more then 4-5 properties of one element at that time we use object.

7) let person1 = {
    name: "Ketul"
    }

    let person2 = {...person1}

8)    cont obj = {
    name : "james",
    lastName : "bond"
}

console.log(`My name is ${lastName}. ${name} ${lastName}`);
